# *My Mechanicsville Memories*: Paradata
Written by Meranda Gallupe-Paton

Created for HIST5706: Digital History with Dr. Shawn Graham

## Introduction
Paradata is a peek behind the curtain of a digital history project. This document outlines the motivations for creation of *My Mechanicsville Memories*, the relevant theoretical frameworks, and addresses the decision-making processes that formed this project. 

## Why has this project been created? 
*My Mechanicsville Memories* was created for the course HIST5706: Digital History at Carleton University in Fall 2021. This project is part of a larger research project that I am working on for my Master’s Research Project where I aim to explore this place-based memories of Mechanicsville, a once working class neighbourhood in Ottawa that is currently in the throes of gentrification. 

Working within the scope of this course, I focused on the storytelling elements of this work. I set out to start the process of crafting a narrative with the data I had collected thus far, namely oral history interviews and some audio/visual content I had collected of present-day Mechanicsville.

Ultimately, I also wanted to use this opportunity to explore my own subjectivity regarding the topic. Having lived most of my life in Mechanicsville, I have my own memories and perspective that colour how I conduct this research. By framing this project as a self-reflexive exercise, I have developed a better understanding of my own positionality moving forward.

## Theory and Form
The primary theoretical framework for this project is autoethnography, an approach where researchers “use personal experience to describe—and sometimes critique—cultural beliefs, experiences, practices, and identities.”[^1] Autoethnographers often employ a story format to share their work and “offer others ways of working through their feelings”, essentially offering “equipment for living” to their audience.[^2] This is why my own memories are so central to this digital history. I wanted to use my experiences with gentrification and a rapidly changing place to explore these phenomena from a more personal perspective. 

Digital storytelling in particular lends itself well to narratives that center the creator themselves, like autoethnographic work. The digital revolution gave a wider range of people the tools and ability to tell their own stories, rather than “[tolerating] media being done *to* us.”[^3] “Scrollytelling” is an evolution of digital storytelling. Scrollytelling stories are web-based experiences where “new content appears or changes through transitions as users scroll down or up the web page.”[^4] This format is popular for its immersive quality, giving audiences a “sense of control, exploration and discoverability inherent to scrolling.”[^5]

## Process
*My Mechanicsville Memories* is a scrollytelling story created using [Mural](https://www.getmural.io/). Mural is described as a “desktop app created with Electron” which you can use “to create rich scrollytelling stories with a simple to use form based interface and your curated multimedia content.”[^6] In essence, you download the Mural application which allows you to edit your website and upload media files all in one intuitive platform. Once you finish your story, Mural exports your project with all the necessary code and content, which can be uploaded to a web server and shared online. 

Mural gave me a lot of freedom while still being slightly confined and having my hand held in the website-making process. What drew me to Mural was how easy-to-use their editor was and how it yielded beautiful results. With Mural, it didn’t feel like my beginner-intermediate level technology knowledge was a barrier to entry. I started creating *My Mechanicsville Memories* with some basic skills with html and website knowledge, but was not confident by any means. This was frustrating before I found Mural because I wanted my project to appear polished, but knew that my limited timeline wouldn’t account for the steep learning curve necessary to fully grasp a coding language. I struggled with what I thought were “basic concepts”, like creating static websites through github or embedding a Google My Map. With hindsight, I see that these were the times where I learned the most and gained the skills that would be necessary for creating my final project. I started seeing connections that linked all the things I was learning and saw how to use what I learned to solve later problems. I began to see technology as a vehicle for my vision, rather than a mountain to conquer. 

An example of this was how I ultimately ended up showcasing my Mural story. My biggest hesitation with Mural was not knowing how to share the story with others. With no experience in website hosting or servers, I felt lost. In what I thought was an outlandish idea, I suggested using github and their pages publishing feature. With vital encouragement from Dr. Graham, I was able to successfully share the website you see today. 

The biggest drawback I experienced with Mural was the limitations of what you can do in the Mural editor app. A lot of final touches needed to be done in the index.html document once all the content of the site was uploaded to github. For examples of what needed to be done outside of the editor, please see my devlogs 4, 5, and 6 [here](https://github.com/merandagp/HIST5706-DevLogs). Particularly, I had issues with overlaying audio over the slideshow sections and had to do a lot of work in html for them to function.

## Future for the project
Like any digital history, my work has limitations. This story is clearly only telling one version of the history of Mechanicsville. While I do incorporate two slightly differing perspectives through my parents’ interviews, our fields of experience are heavily overlapping, and thus aren’t that diverse. I tried to make it clear in the story and structure of the project that this is just my very narrow view of this history and being upfront at the beginning about the narrow scope of *My Mechanicsville Memories*.

Moving forward, I would like to further explore the capabilities of scrollytelling and how it could be used to showcase a wider range of narratives. One way I have envisioned to include counter-narratives, is to create a open-navigation virtual exhibit which includes a handful of short scrollytelling stories about specific themes, similar to *My Mechanicsville Memories*, and that allows the audience to choose which one they experience, for how long, and in what order. This work is still in its preliminary stages and will need further investigation.
