# Mural Test Log
## Week 8 - November 8, 2021

### What was I trying to do
I wanted to test my hypothesis about being able to host my Mural creation through github pages, essentially rendering a static site. This was after my thinking was confirmed by Dr. Graham, who encouraged me to try it out. 

### What I did
These are the steps I followed
1. Exported my mural from the editing platform, this gives me a .zip 
2. Extract/unzip the content in this file (I forgot the first time but this is important!)
3. Create a new public repo on my github which I called MuralTest (make sure to add a .readme file)
4. Add the contents of the unzipped .zip folder to this repo
5. Go to repo settings > Github Pages and initiate pages by choosing source: main folder: root
6. Then went to https://merandagp.github.io/Muraltest/ to look at my work! Here's what it looked like:

### Results reflection
I am just so happy that it worked! I had some issues with the static websites tutorial so I was worried that my logic was flawed in thinking so this was a nice confidence boost. And helped me prove to myself that I am learning, and sometimes (most times) trial and error are great teachers. This was a perfect example of using technology to solve a problem, rather than letting the tech be a problem. It was hard for me to undertsand how I would go about setting up a way to host my Mural with my current resources, but sometimes the answers are hidden right under our nose with the resources we already have. 

### Next steps
This has me really excited to add more content to my Mural and flesh out what I'm envisioning for the project. I need to get a clearer idea of my storyboard to know what my next steps should be in terms of adding more content. I also want to work on customizing my landing page, which seems like my biggest difficulty right now because it's not as clear cut as uploading pictures for the other sections.
