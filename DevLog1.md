# My Mechanicsville Memories: Devlog 1
## Week 7 - November 7, 2021

### The Idea
My digital history project is a small branch of my MRP research on the history of the Mechanicsville neighbourhood here in Ottawa. For this project, which I am tentatively calling "My Mechanicsville Memories", I'm aiming to explore my subjectivity on the topic through my own memories of growing up in the area. To do so, I want to create a digital story using [Mural](https://www.getmural.io/) that compares the present to the past and incorporates sounds, photos, and videos.  

### Data of interest
I've chosen to work with the oral histories, sounds, photos, and videos that I have already collected for my MRP. There are a few reasons for this choice. Above all, using the same data for both projects allows me to deepen my engagement with the data by exploring it from multiple angles and for different purposes. Additionally, one of the main reasons I choose to work on the history of Mechanicsville is that the history has been vastly under-researched. There is limited primary sources and only a handful of secondary sources that address the neighbourhood specifically. Even with web scrapping techniques, there just isn't a vast historical record of this area that exists. 

### What I've done to date
So far, I've recorded two oral history interviews and have been working with [NVIVO Transcription](https://library.carleton.ca/services/nvivo) to produce a written transcript of the audio files. While NVIVO has a relatively quick turn around to create a basic transcript, I have had to spend time going through and editting the initial transcripts for more accuracy. I've also been recording sounds and taking photos/videos while I walk around the neighbourhood of different sites of interest that spark memories for me. 

On the storytelling side, I've been working on roughly storyboarding my vision for my final project. This has entailed deciding what kinds of memories I want to share, and what content I need to show them. This is still very rough so I don't feel comfortable sharing just yet, but stay tuned!

I've also been playing around with the Mural editting software to get a feel for the platform, its mechanics, and possibilities. Reading through the [how it works](https://www.getmural.io/docs/intro/) section on Mural's website has been super helpful in understanding the platform-specific terminology. I've created a very basic test that can be found in a .zip file in this repo (unsure if others will be able to open it, see challenges section to learn more)

### Challenges
I struggled for a WHILE deciding what I wanted to make for this course and how exactly I want to go about doing it. This process has made me consider just how gatekept the digital history field still is and confront my feelings surrounding "not belonging". Prior to this course, I would have classified myself in the middle on the "new to tech" to "techy person" scale. But with all the options and interesting projects that have been presented so far throughout the term, I feel more like a fish out of water than ever before. What I keep trying to remind myself is that the variety that exists in the digital history space is one of its draws! Digital history can take SO MANY different forms that challenge us all in different ways, regardless of our digital literacy. While I am still a bit hesitant to be working with a new software, I'm trying my best to swallow my fears and just try things. Getting over these mental blocks has been a huge challenge for me, but I'm slowly warming up to the "fail gloriously" mantra. For now, I'm trying "attempt curiously".

One of the things about Mural that I'm the most confused about right now is hosting, or in terms that I better understand, how do I share the "thing" once it's made. I see when I export my project from Mural's editing software, it comes out as a zip file with both HTML and Java scripts. From what I understand, one should be able to add this to their own server or domain (note to self, I should really look up the difference between those two) and it should publish from there? But what if one doesn't have their own domain? I'm wondering if I can publish it through github pages like in the static sites tutorial but unsure if that's even a viable approach. So in summary, I still need to better understand how my Mural story goes from being in my editor software to being a real website.
